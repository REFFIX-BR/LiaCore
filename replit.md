## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, `shadcn/ui`, and Tailwind CSS, draws inspiration from Carbon Design System and Linear, supporting dark/light modes. Key features include color-coded wait times, enhanced complaint descriptions, private note dialogs, new contact creation, conversation reopening, and activity logs. Dashboards for sales and plans management offer KPIs and CRUD interfaces. The chat interface provides message pagination, auto-scroll, auto-focus, and inline PDF viewing. The agent conversation interface supports flexible layout modes (single-box for focus, dual-box for multitasking), with preferences persisted locally.

### Technical Implementations
**Frontend**: Uses TanStack Query for server state management.
**Backend**: Node.js and Express.js (TypeScript) integrate GPT-5 for routing, OpenAI Assistants API, Upstash Vector for RAG, Upstash Redis for conversation threads, and PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. BullMQ with Redis TLS handles asynchronous processing.
**AI & Knowledge Management**: Orchestrates seven specialized AI assistants using a "Receptionist-First" routing model. A dual-layer RAG architecture with Upstash Vector supports specific knowledge bases. Custom function calling enables verification, knowledge queries, invoice lookups, scheduling, sales operations, automated CRM ticket creation, service order (OS) status checks, payment promise registration, document persistence, and payment clearance verification. Flexible client identification (CPF/CNPJ/CLIENT_CODE) is implemented. The system preserves full context during assistant routing, automatically creates CRM tickets, and handles multiple installation points. AI-to-AI routing is supported.
**Prompt Management System**: AI-powered prompt editor with version control, draft workflows, semantic versioning, GPT-4o AI analysis, real-time token counting, and automatic OpenAI Assistants API synchronization.
**Context Quality Monitoring System**: Automated real-time monitoring of AI conversation context with detectors for duplicate data requests, ignored history, duplicate routing, and context reset, providing AI-powered prompt correction suggestions.
**Gamification System**: Automated performance ranking with a configurable V2 system for scoring parameters and a badge system.
**Real-Time Monitoring**: The Supervisor Dashboard offers KPIs, live queues, alerts, transcripts, human intervention controls, and a Live Logs System.
**Agent Dashboard Enhancements**: Supports period-based filtering for performance metrics, including accurate TMA calculation.
**Continuous Learning System**: A GPT-4 agent suggests prompt improvements.
**Hybrid Supervised Mode**: Manages "Transferred" and "Assigned" conversations with AI-assisted agent responses.
**WhatsApp Integration**: Native integration with Evolution API supporting 3 WhatsApp instances with end-to-end instance routing.
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A 3-tier system (ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, AGENT) with granular permissions.
**Contact Management System**: Centralized client database with automatic WhatsApp contact sync.
**Announcements/Communications System**: Centralized system for company-wide announcements with priority-based rotation.
**COBRANÇAS - Autonomous Debt Collection Module**: Production-ready WhatsApp-based collection module with dedicated IA Cobrança assistant specialized in empathetic debt negotiation, payment promise registration, and compliance. Fully automated WhatsApp messaging via Evolution API with Meta-approved templates.
**Payment Promise System**: Manages the complete lifecycle of payment promises, enforcing a single active promise per client, automated registration, multi-layer protection during collection attempts, and automatic breach detection.
**Dedicated Cobranças Monitoring**: Conversations from collection campaigns are monitored via a dedicated `/voice/monitor` interface, providing unified metrics and transfer capabilities.
**Messaging Control Center**: Professional control panel for flexible contact method management with global and per-campaign configuration, backend validation, and method-specific statistics API.
**Campaign Conversation Tracking**: Complete integration between WhatsApp collection campaigns and cobranças monitoring, linking conversations to campaign targets.
**WhatsApp-Only Architecture (November 2025)**: System simplified to WhatsApp-only collection flow. Removed Twilio voice infrastructure including voice_call_attempts, voice_configs, and voice_feature_flags tables. Campaign ingestion now directly enqueues targets to WhatsApp collection worker. Metrics and monitoring focus exclusively on WhatsApp performance.
**Automated CRM Synchronization**: Production-ready infrastructure for proactive debt collection, importing overdue clients from CRM API. Features include configurable sync schedules, data transformation, smart deduplication, accurate campaign statistics tracking, and comprehensive error handling. Includes a CRM Import UI for managing sync configurations and manual triggers.
**Meta-Approved WhatsApp Templates**: Collections module uses Meta-approved WhatsApp templates for regulatory compliance. Template "financeiro_em_atraso" (English language, `en`) on "Cobranca" instance features header with named variable {{texto}} for client first name. Enhanced sendWhatsAppTemplate() function in server/lib/whatsapp.ts supports both positional ({{1}}, {{2}}) and named variables ({{texto}}, {{customer_name}}) via headerParameters and bodyParameters interfaces with automatic parameter_name field injection for Evolution API compatibility. Legacy parameters array preserved for backward compatibility, mapped to bodyParameters.
**evolutionInstance Normalization**: Accent-insensitive validation ensures "Cobrança" and "Cobranca" are treated identically throughout the system. getEffectiveEvolutionInstance() helper preserves existing conversation instances when webhooks lack instance data, preventing incorrect routing overrides.
**AI Cobrança Prompt Fix**: Corrected critical prompt issue where AI incorrectly announced "Parece que houve um problema ao tentar gerar a segunda via do boleto" even when boleto consultation succeeded. Root cause: confusing negative instructions in ETAPA 8 ("NUNCA mencione 'preciso gerar novo boleto'"). Solution: replaced with clear positive instructions ("Seja direto e positivo ao enviar o boleto"). Prompt updated from v1.0.2 to v1.01 via scripts/fix-cobranca-boleto-prompt.ts.
**Phone Normalization System**: Comprehensive phone number normalization infrastructure implemented to prevent WhatsApp blank message defect caused by Evolution API silently rejecting malformed phone numbers. Centralized normalizePhone() utility in server/lib/phone-utils.ts enforces canonical format (55XXXXXXXXXXX digits-only with 55 prefix) across ALL data persistence paths: storage.createVoiceCampaignTarget(s) and storage.updateVoiceCampaignTarget automatically normalize phoneNumber and alternativePhones, filtering invalid numbers and setting null when no valid alternatives exist. Data fix script (scripts/fix-campaign-target-phones.ts) sanitized 1,598 existing campaign targets. Post-fix validation confirmed 0 malformed numbers across entire voice_campaign_targets dataset (1,594 records). Production-ready with automated functional tests.
**Selective Target Activation System**: Production-ready bulk enable/disable controls for managing collection volume in voice campaigns. Schema enhancement: `enabled` boolean field (default true) added to voiceCampaignTargets with composite index (campaignId, enabled, state) for optimal query performance. Backend: `bulkToggleVoiceCampaignTargets()` storage method executes transactional updates and automatically recalculates campaign statistics. API endpoint POST /api/voice/targets/bulk-toggle with admin/supervisor authentication, Zod validation, and comprehensive error handling. Frontend UI: VoiceTargets page features multi-select checkboxes (master + individual), selection counter in CardDescription, conditional bulk action buttons ("Habilitar Selecionados" / "Desabilitar Selecionados"), "Habilitado" status column with badge indicators, mutation feedback with toast notifications, and automatic cache invalidation. UX: Action buttons only appear when targets are selected, selection clears automatically after successful operations, and loading states prevent duplicate submissions. Architecture: Separation of concerns maintained - queue cleanup for disabled targets deferred to separate orchestrator service. Voice workers must be updated to check `enabled=true` before processing targets.
**WhatsApp Retry & Rate Limiting System (November 2025)**: Production-ready automatic retry system for stuck WhatsApp messages with intelligent rate limiting to prevent Evolution API violations. **Rate Limiter**: Redis-based token bucket (6 tokens, 1 refill/10s = 360 msg/h base rate) shared between collection and retry workers with fail-open behavior on Redis errors. **Message Tracking**: Real-time webhook handler for Evolution API MESSAGES_UPDATE events tracking status progression (PENDING → SERVER_ACK → DELIVERY_ACK → READ → ERROR) with denormalized updates to both messages and voiceCampaignTargets tables. **Template Metadata Persistence**: JSONB field stores complete template data (templateName, languageCode, headerParameters, bodyParameters, evolutionInstance) enabling accurate retries without hardcoded values. **Retry Worker**: Exponential backoff (30min → 60min → 120min + jitter), maximum 3 attempts, intelligent error classification (permanent 401/403/404 → immediate ERROR, transient 429/503/timeout → retry with backoff), automatic target state synchronization. **Retry Scheduler**: Scans every 10 minutes for PENDING messages >30 minutes old, batch limit 100 messages/cycle, idempotent job IDs (`retry-${messageId}-attempt-${attemptNumber}`) prevent duplicate retries. **Schema Extensions**: Six WhatsApp fields added to messages table (whatsappMessageId, whatsappStatus, whatsappStatusUpdatedAt, whatsappRetryCount, whatsappLastRetryAt, whatsappTemplateMetadata) with indexes for efficient retry queries. **Queue Integration**: whatsapp-retry queue processes stuck messages with concurrency=1 to respect rate limits, automatic requeue on transient failures, permanent failure detection prevents infinite retry loops.
